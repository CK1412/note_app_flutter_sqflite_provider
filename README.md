## üëã Introduce

This is a note taking app made with **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)** that helps you to take notes of important things on your phone anytime without internet connection. (Design ideas based on Google Keep App)

The application I created for the purpose of learning to review knowledge such as CRUD SQlite, Provider (state management) and learn some new knowledge such as application internationalization, freeing memory.

During the implementation process, I encountered some silly errors and promptly fixed them. Difficulties I have encountered:
- delete image files and cache when not in use
- error when undoing a note
- listen for changes when creating new labels
- display grid list of images
- meet some errors on performance related async/await, query sqlite
- and there are some more problems

Finally after a while looking for a fix, I finished this application. I tried to optimize the lines of code to the best of my ability (at the time of project implementation), but of course there will be errors or inadequacies. Looking forward to receiving your valuable contributions.

***Don't hesitate to give this project 1 üåü if you like it. Thank you***
